My first independent project made in React.JS

After finishing my React.JS course, I decided that I needed to put my acquired knowledge into practice. With that in mind, I decided to make a pokedex using the API from https://pokeapi.co/.

Nesse projeto eu utilizei as seguintes funcionalidades:

- Infinite scroll (and fetch more data at the end)
- Loading Screen
- State, Effect and Context hooks
- Links

The project is not finished yet, I still want to implement complex search bar, more pokemon information and some design alterations.

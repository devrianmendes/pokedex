# Pokedex React
This is my first independent project built with React.js after completing my React.js course. I wanted to put the knowledge I gained into practice by building a Pokedex app using the PokeAPI, which provides data about Pokémon.

# Features
In this project, I implemented the following features:

Infinite Scroll: Fetch more data as the user scrolls down.
Loading Screen: Display a loading screen while data is being fetched.
React Hooks: Utilized state, effect, and context hooks to manage the application’s state and side effects.
Links: Added navigation between different pages to view details about each Pokémon.

# Technologies Used
- Frontend:
  - React.js for building the user interface.
  - CSS for styling the application.
  - PokeAPI for fetching Pokémon data.

# Improvements and Next Steps
While the project is functional, there are still a few features I want to improve and add:

- Implement a more complex search bar to allow users to search for Pokémon by different attributes (name, type, etc.).
- Display more detailed Pokémon information, such as abilities, stats, and evolutions.
- Make some design alterations to improve the user interface and user experience.

# Prerequisites
Before running the project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 16.x or higher)
- **Git** to clone the repository.

# Installation
- Clone the repository:
  - Command: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pokedex-react.git

- Navigate to the project directory:
  - cd pokedex-react

- Install the dependencies:
  - npm install

- Run the application:
  - npm start
    
Your app will be running at http://localhost:3000/.
